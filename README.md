# CryptEx---C-Cryptocurrency-Exchange
CryptEx is a feature-rich cryptocurrency exchange software, developed using C++ and designed with a console-based interface. This project showcases the implementation of object-oriented techniques, making use of concepts like maps, vectors, and various built-in functions from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
User-Friendly Console Interface: CryptEx offers an intuitive console-based interface, allowing users to interact with the exchange seamlessly. Through simple commands and prompts, users can perform various operations related to cryptocurrency trading.

Cryptocurrency Trading: Experience the excitement of trading cryptocurrencies within the simulated environment of CryptEx. Buy, sell, and track digital assets using the exchange's real-time market data.

Object-Oriented Design: CryptEx employs object-oriented programming principles to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. Each component of the exchange is encapsulated within well-defined classes, promoting code reusability and readability.

STL Utilization: The project leverages the power of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to efficiently manage data structures like maps and vectors. This approach optimizes memory usage and enhances the overall performance of the exchange.

Secure Transactions: CryptEx emphasizes security, implementing robust mechanisms to protect user data and ensure secure transactions.

Realistic Simulation: While CryptEx is a console-based project, it provides a realistic simulation of cryptocurrency exchange functionalities, providing an immersive learning experience.
